# cryptography
This repository contains projects that I did for my independent study on data encryption.

I started by creating a caesar cipher, then created a polyalphabetic cipher.

My final project was creating an algorithm that combined a substitution cipher with a transposition cipher, which is much more secure than either of them alone.
